NMRC Project Report

Key Overview:

Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) in Railway Signalling Systems:

The report discusses the implementation of Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) in railway signalling systems. It highlights the use of radio communication for train control information transfer, as well as the role of Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) in monitoring train operations and remote control of stations. The functions of Automatic Train Protection (ATP) and Automatic Train Operation (ATO) in ensuring safe and efficient railway traffic management are outlined.

The author acknowledges their training experience at Noida Metro Rail Corporation Ltd., expressing gratitude to their training guides and institution for the opportunities provided. The paper emphasizes the critical role of Operations Control Center (OCC) as the nerve center of the metro rail system, handling various aspects such as station departures and malfunctioning rolling stock.

Passenger Information Systems and Radio Network Infrastructure:

In terms of practical systems, the report delves into the Passenger Information Display System (PIDS), Master Clock System (MCS), and Public Address System (PAS) in ensuring clear communication and emergency response in stations. It discusses the implementation of the Dimetra Radio Network Infrastructure (RNI) for voice and data communications. 

Infrastructure and Support Systems Overview:

The discussion further encompasses the importance and functionality of Platform Screen Doors, Automatic Fare Collection (AFC), Power Distribution, CCTV Surveillance, and the role of UPS System in providing power backup for stations and depots. 

CBTC System Implementation and Technical Details:

The report extensively covers the implementation and technical details of the CBTC system, including its architecture with onboard and wayside subsystems, communication systems, and components such as Balise, Interlocking, and Master Clock. It also highlights the increased capacity and operational efficiency achieved through CBTC. 

Train Protection and Supervision Functions:

Lastly, the report acknowledges the train protection and supervision functions, such as axle counters, and concludes by addressing the potential challenges and risks associated with CBTC systems. 

Summary and Conclusion:

In summation, the report provides an in-depth overview of the technical aspects and practical implementation of CBTC in railway signalling systems, highlighting the critical role of various subsystems in ensuring safe and efficient railway operations.
